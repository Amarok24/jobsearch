## Online version

## Aim of the project
A (somehow) useful and fast jobsearch experience. Project is influenced by https://www.jobs.com and uses the same API for search results.

### Job search in following countries is currently supported:
USA, Canada, Germany, Austria, Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Czechia

### Urgent upcoming changes:
- bugfixes in mobile version (language switch)
- better layout / design
- settings menu with light/dark mode switch
- code cleanup in TypeScript

### Non-urgent plans:
- sorting of search results
- maybe use of IndexedDB for search result storage and manipulation
