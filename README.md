A lightweight job search, made in vanilla JavaScript.

## Online version

A (somehow) useful and fast jobsearch experience. Project is influenced by https://www.jobs.com and uses the same API for search results.

### Job search in following countries is currently supported:
USA, Canada, Germany, Austria, Great Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Czechia

### TODO:

- completely responsive CSS (grid)
- sorting of search results
- maybe use of IndexedDB for search result storage and manipulation
